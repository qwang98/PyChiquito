# Technical Design
- Python functions for creating AST in PyChiquito
  - Status: DONE and debugged with Fibo example.
- Python functions for creating WG object and FG in PyChiquito
  - Status: DONE and debugged WG with Fibo example. FG not debugged yet.
- Convert Rust module to Python library using PyO3 and Maturin
  - Status: DONE for AST.
- Design Json serialization standard in Python.
  - Status: DONE for AST and TraceWitness.
- Implement Json deserialization with Serde in Rust.
  - Status: DONE for AST and TraceWitness.
- Call Chiquito rust functions from Python with AST and WG object in Python
  - Status: DONE for AST and TraceWitness.
- Convert TraceWitness to assignment in Rust.
  - Status: Still researching due to the complexity of `AssignmentGenerator`.
- Create Rust bindings for generating and verifiying proof, using Halo2 boilerplate.
  - Status: Not started.
