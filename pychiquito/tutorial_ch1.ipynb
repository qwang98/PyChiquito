    "# Chapter 1: Introduction to PyChiquito\n",
    "Welcome to PyChiquito, a step-based high-level rust DSL (pychiquito is a python DSL for chiquito) that provides better syntax and abstraction for constraint building and column placement when writing PLONKish circuits, which supports custom gates and lookup arguments. PyChiquito has a Halo2 backend, which is a low level zkDSL that writes circuits using the PLONKish arithemtization. PyChiquito is working on supporting additional backends.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyChiquito is composed of two parts. [The Python part](https://github.com/qwang98/PyChiquito) exposes functions that user writes circuits with. [The Rust part](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/chiquito) is called by the Python functions behind the scenes and converts what the user writes into a Halo2 circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key advantages of PyChiquito include: \n",
    "- Abstraction and simplification on the readability and learnability of Halo2 circuits.\n",
    "- Composabiity with other Halo2 circuits.\n",
    "- Modularity of using multiple frontends (Python and Rust) and backends (Halo2 and beyond).\n",
    "- Smooth user experience with a dynamically typed language (Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "For more on why you need PyChiquito, refer to the [Chiquito README](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/chiquito#readme) and the [Appendix](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/chiquito/blob/main/Appendix.md/#design-principles) on its design principles. For more on PLONKish concepts and Halo2 circuits, refer to the [Halo2 book](https://zcash.github.io/halo2/index.html)."
