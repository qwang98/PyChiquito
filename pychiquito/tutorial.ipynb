    "# Chapter 1: Introduction to PyChiquito\n",
    "Welcome to PyChiquito, a step-based high-level rust DSL (pychiquito is a python DSL for chiquito) that provides better syntax and abstraction for constraint building and column placement when writing PLONKish circuits, which supports custom gates and lookup arguments. PyChiquito has a Halo2 backend, which is a low level zkDSL that writes circuits using the PLONKish arithemtization. PyChiquito is working on supporting additional backends.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyChiquito is composed of two parts. [The Python part](https://github.com/qwang98/PyChiquito) exposes functions that user writes circuits with. [The Rust part](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/chiquito) is called by the Python functions behind the scenes and converts what the user writes into a Halo2 circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key advantages of PyChiquito include: \n",
    "- Abstraction and simplification on the readability and learnability of Halo2 circuits.\n",
    "- Composabiity with other Halo2 circuits.\n",
    "- Modularity of using multiple frontends (Python and Rust) and backends (Halo2 and beyond).\n",
    "- Smooth user experience with a dynamically typed language (Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "For more on why you need PyChiquito, refer to the [Chiquito README](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/chiquito#readme) and the [Appendix](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/chiquito/blob/main/Appendix.md/#design-principles) on its design principles. For more on PLONKish concepts and Halo2 circuits, refer to the [Halo2 book](https://zcash.github.io/halo2/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Chapter 2: Quick Start\n",
    "PyChiquito requires using a Python virtual environment for its dependencies, which you should have setup following the [PyChiquito README](https://github.com/qwang98/PyChiquito#readme).\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, after cloning PyChiquito, you need to run the following commands in your local repo (NOT in this Jupyter Notebook), till you see `(.env)` at the start of your command line, which means that you've successfully enabled the virtual environment. You also need to install `maturin` and `py_ecc` dependencies to your local environment and build the project using `maturin develop`. Again, these are all done in your local command line."

PyChiquito is a step-based language, for which we configure different \"step types\". Each step type defines different relationships among the signals. Each circuit is an arbitrary combination of arbitrary instances of step types. Think of the step types as different burger ingredients, such as bun, lettuce, and patties. Think of their instantiation as combining different amounts of ingredients to make the burger, such as 1 bun, 1 lettuce, 2 patties, and 1 bun. Think of the PyChiquito circuit as the burger you create. It's that simple!\n",

Because we can assign different values to the same signal at different step instances, we can query the signal at different positions, and that's why signals are also called `Queriable` in PyChiquito. There are signals that live on the circuit top-level, called \"forward signals\", which we can query at different step instances. There are signals that live in a specific step type, called \"internal signals\".\n",

    "In the following example, we add two signals, \"a\" and \"b\", to the Fibonacci circuit. Here, signal definitions start with `self.a` and `self.b`, because we append them directly to the Circuit.
