    "# Chapter 2: Quick Start\n",
    "PyChiquito requires using a Python virtual environment for its dependencies, which you should have setup following the [PyChiquito README](https://github.com/qwang98/PyChiquito#readme).\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, after cloning PyChiquito, you need to run the following commands in your local repo (NOT in this Jupyter Notebook), till you see `(.env)` at the start of your command line, which means that you've successfully enabled the virtual environment. You also need to install `maturin` and `py_ecc` dependencies to your local environment and build the project using `maturin develop`. Again, these are all done in your local command line.\n",

    "python3 -m venv .env\n",
    "\n",
    "source .env/bin/activate\n",
    "\n",
    "pip install maturin\n",
    "pip install py_ecc\n",
    "\n",
    "maturin develop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, run the following in your local command line to navigate to the `PyChiquito/pychiquito` directory which contains all the Python files and activate Jupyter Lab. Finally, in the browser, navigate to `tutorial_ch3_pt1.ipynb` to start using the interactive part of this tutorial.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once in Jupyter Lab browser, make sure you are using the Python virtual environment rather than default for kernel."
